### **Fine-Tuning Idefics2 for Multimodal Tasks**

#### **Overview**
This project fine-tunes the **Idefics2-8b** model for **Visual Question Answering (VQA)** using the **DocVQA dataset**. The model handles multimodal inputs (text and images) and generates concise answers, making it ideal for tasks like document analysis, conversational AI, and educational tools.

### **Features**
1. **Multimodal Processing**: Combines images and text for enhanced understanding.
2. **Efficient Fine-Tuning**:
   - **QLoRA (4-bit Quantization)** for memory efficiency.
   - **LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)** for layer-specific fine-tuning.
3. **Custom Data Collation**: Prepares datasets into a chat-like format with image and text inputs.
4. **Streamlined Training**:
   - Mixed precision (FP16).
   - Gradient accumulation and checkpoint saving.
5. **Flash Attention**: Optimized for modern GPUs (e.g., A100).

### **Setup**
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install git+https://github.com/huggingface/transformers.git
   pip install accelerate datasets peft bitsandbytes
   ```
2. Train and evaluate the model using the DocVQA dataset.
